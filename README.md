One repository to analyze them all. Stars, galaxies, AGNs, quasars, pulsars, neutron stars. Even BLACK HOLES.

There are currently two folders in the repository. 

One is on AGN (active galactic nuclei) black holes, pretty basic Pandas data exploration and a scatter plot of two variables.

The other one is a working project: EDA and basic regression on stellar data. I will try to optimize **classification models** in the notebook.
